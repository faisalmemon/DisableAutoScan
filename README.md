# DisableAutoScan
https://stackoverflow.com/q/75420561/2715565

This is a simple prototype code sample which shows how you can either use the automatic method of camera text scanning or use a manually driven approach.

- Use the Manual button to see how a manual capture of text can be done.
- Use the Auto button to see how an automatic capture of text can be done.

To get the app to run, you must have a hardware device to connect to.  Simulator won't work.
You will need to update the Team ID of the project to your Team.
